Will You Be My Date?
A fun and interactive project to propose in a playful way. This app asks the classic question: "Will you date me?", but with a twist! The "No" button avoids being clicked, while the "Yes" button asks for confirmation before accepting. ðŸ’•

Features
"Yes" Button Confirmation:

The button asks, "Are you sure?" before confirming the relationship.
On confirmation, it displays a romantic message: "You accepted to date me! I love you, my darling!".
"No" Button Escape:

The "No" button dodges the user's mouse, making it impossible to click.
